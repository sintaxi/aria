# Aria

A crappy wrapper for a crappy API. Basically makes request to API and parses the SOAP response.

## Installation

I always recommend you bundle your dependencies with your application. To do
this, create a `package.json` file in the root of your project with the minimum
information...

    {
      "name": "yourapplication",
      "verson": "0.0.1",
      "dependencies": {
        "aria": "0.2.1"
      }
    }

Then run the following command using npm...

    npm install

OR, if you just want to start playing with the library run...

    npm install aria

## Docs

    var aria = require("aria")({
      "url"       : "https://secure.future.stage.ariasystems.net/api/ws/api_ws_class_dispatcher.php",
      "client_no" : "abcdefg",
      "auth_key"  : "1234567890"
    })

Has only one public function.

### req(method, args, callback)
        
    aria.req("get_acct_no_from_user_id", { "user_id": "f2f4d962-cb44-4bc8-82c9-2d13bdd97128" }, function(result){
      console.log(result.error_code)
    })
